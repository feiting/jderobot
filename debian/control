Description: jde is a software development suite for robotics applications.
 jde.c is a software development suite for robotics applications, written
 in C language. It provides a programming environment where the robot control
 program is made up of a collection of several concurrent asynchronous threads
 named schemas. It is based on JDE cognitive architecture for autonomous robots
